senaite.panic
=============

This add-on enables panic level alerts for `SENAITE LIMS`_ by means of the
integration of panic ranges in Analysis Specifications. `senaite.panic`_ adds
two sub-fields *min_panic* and *max_panic*: when the result of an analysis falls
outside the valid range and below *min_panic* or above *max_panic*, a warning
message is displayed next to the analysis and an informative panel in Sample's
view as well. From this informative panel, lab manager can easily send an e-mail
notification to the client contact, as well as to other key personnel.
